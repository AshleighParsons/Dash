# Dash

## Application Outline:
Dash is a productivity increasing app. It aims to allow users to create and track project sprints.
Users can add sprints, edit, delete or add tasks to those sprints, and check off, edit or delete tasks. The user will receive a notification when a sprint is created.

I believe that this would benefit creatives who need to keep track of their projects and time.
